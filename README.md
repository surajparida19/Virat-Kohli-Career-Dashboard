# Virat-Kohli-Career-Dashboard
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using BI tools to visualize and analyze Virat Kohli’s cricket career statistics. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators such as total runs, centuries, half-centuries, strike rate, and match-winning performances across Test, ODI, and T20 formats. Users can explore Kohli’s performance through dynamic charts, graphs, and filters, allowing comparisons over different years, venues, and opponents. The project demonstrates how BI tools can transform raw sports data into insightful visualizations, offering a deeper understanding of a player’s career and overall performance trends.
